%function calib_gui(mode)

% calib_gui(mode)
%
% Runs the Camera Calibration Toolbox.
% Set mode to 1 to run the memory efficient version.
% Any other value for mode will run the normal version (see documentation)
%
% INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEMORY EFFICIENT MODE FOR THE CAMERA CALIBRATION TOOLBOX:
%
% If your calibration images are large, or if you calibrate using a lot of images, you may have experienced memory problems
% in Matlab when using the calibration toolbox (OUT OF MEMORY errors). If this is the case, you can now run the
% new memory efficient version of the toolbox that loads every image one by one without storing them all in memory.
% If you choose to run the standard version of the toolbox now, you can always switch to the other memory efficient mode
% later in case the OUT OF MEMORY error message is encountered. The two modes of operation are totally compatible.
